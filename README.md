# Concurrentia
 
Concurrentia is a GitHub project that contains multiple programming problems related to concurrency. These problems have been implemented and are ready to be used as learning resources or as benchmarks for testing concurrency control protocols and synchronization techniques.

The challenges in this project include:

"01_A-game-of-NIM-main": An implementation of the game of Nim it doesn't necessarily use threads, it's here just for the graphic part.
"02_Family_Tree": A family tree builder using concurrent programming techniques.
"03_Train_Problem": A system for managing trains that can operate concurrently and avoid collisions.
"04_Consumer_Producer_Problem": An implementation of a producer-consumer system that avoids common concurrency problems.
"05_Philosophers_Dinner": An implementation of the famous Dining Philosophers problem using a synchronization protocol to allow the philosophers to eat without getting stuck in a deadlock.
"06_Readers_and_Writers": A system that allows multiple readers to access a shared resource simultaneously, while preventing data corruption and other concurrency issues.
"07_Simulation_of_autonomous_traffic": A program that simulates a transit system with automated trains and stations, using concurrent programming techniques to ensure safe and efficient operation.
